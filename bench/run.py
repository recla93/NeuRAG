"""The retrieval benchmark DESIGN-EVOLUTION §7 asks for, as a runnable artefact.

Until now the numbers in §6b (recall@5 67% -> 94%) came from a query set that
lived only in a session: reproducible by nobody, comparable to nothing. §7 asks
for "a fixed ~30-query set over a fixed corpus, IT and EN, with known-good
answers. Recall@5 and MRR recorded per phase. No phase may regress the previous."
Without that as a versioned file, every future change to ranking can only be
argued, not measured. That is the block this removes -- and it earned its keep
immediately: folding spreading activation into `search()` looked obviously
right and measured 13 points of recall WORSE, so it was removed instead of
shipped.

The corpus is the `neurag/` tree itself. Self-hosting is not laziness here: it
is the only corpus that travels with the repo, so a result is reproducible from
a commit hash alone.

    python bench/run.py                  # ingest if needed, measure, print
    python bench/run.py --json > bench/results/P5.json

Read the per-KIND breakdown, not the total. The total hides the finding that
justified hybrid retrieval in the first place: vector-only scored 94% on
paraphrase and 67% overall because it failed the identifier class outright.
A single number cannot regress in the way that matters.

Two honest limits of this set, stated so nobody reads more into a number:
  * ground truth is "the file that contains the answer", found by grep at
    authoring time -- which by construction favours lexical matching on the
    identifier half. That is why the two halves are reported apart.
  * the corpus is a densely cross-referenced repo, not a personal vault of
    loosely related documents. Same caveat as the parking thresholds (§8.1).
